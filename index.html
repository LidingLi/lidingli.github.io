                For this semster at the University of Michigan (winter 2021), I have written some MapReduce program in Java (such as A-Priori Algorithm and K-means), some of which I will post on Github.
                <br>
                Additionally, I am making a summary of Machine Learning methods and data modeling techniques. <a href="https://github.com/LidingLi/Machine_Learning">Link is here</a>&nbsp;
                <br>
                Thirdly, I am writing a project about MapReduce Server that has job queueing,input partitioning, mapping, grouping, reducing and fault tolerance. Estimated completing time is April 2rd.
